### Dining review app

This app uses React hooks to allow the input form to update the preview on the right. 

**Design Decision**

I designed the emoji selector to give the user 5 options to express their emotions after dining somewhere. 

I chose this direction because it combines the simple familiarity of the 5-point rating system used on most review forms with the emotional evocativeness of emoji faces, creating a satisfying and intuitive user experience. On both mobile and desktop, users can easily choose from a wide spectrum of reactions without feeling overwhelmed by too many options, while still providing meaningful data through the form.

I also took the creative liberty of rearranging the form inputs so the emoji selector could be at the top. This aligns better with modern design practices and creates a more balanced aesthetic for the page.
